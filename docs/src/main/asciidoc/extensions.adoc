= Extending Spring Boot


== Adding auto-configuration

== Adding `actuator` integrations

== Adding template generators
`spring.factories`

== Adding web initializrs
`spring.factories`

== Adding `starter` dependencies

== Adding `sample` dependencies

== Creating Your Own Spring Initializr

== Adding a Spring Boot CLI extension
You can use the Spring Boot CLI to teach Boot new tricks. For example, Boot 1.2 features support for code-generating projects based on the Spring Initializr. You might for example support a parameterized Spring Initializr CLI extension that code-generated a suitable project in a way that favors the auto-configurations and starters that we've just seen.
