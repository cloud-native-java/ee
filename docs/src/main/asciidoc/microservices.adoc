== Spring Integration Java configuration DSL to show a websocket example. (see my blog on spring.io

== Emergent patterns of microservices
There are patterns common to microservices that only become available after building microservices. https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/15/building-a-spring-integration-4-1-websocket-endpoint

 * distributed / versioned configuration
 * service registration and discovery
 * routing
 * service-to-service calls
 * load balancing
 * circuit breakers
 * asynchronous, distributed messaging

== The Netflix Stack

== Using the Spring Cloud Configuration Server
=== accessing distributed configuration from Github.com
=== configuration refresh and reload

== Service Discovery and Registration with Netflix's Eureka

== Other consensus systems
basically take a look at the various `DiscoveryClient` implementations

=== etcd
=== ZooKeeper
=== Consul
=== Lattice
=== Cloud Foundry
== Dynamic Routing with Zuul, Netflix's API Gateway

== Managing the Cascade of Failure with Hystrix
=== _Release It!_'s Reliability Patterns

== The Service Platform (Cloud Foundry)

A look at the role of the PaaS (discussed in the  <<spring-cloud-paas,Spring Cloud PaaS connectors>>).
